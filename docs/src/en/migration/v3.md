## Legacy removed

Legacy package which supports Valine and `@waline/client@v1` has been removed.

## Import changes

Now you should import the ES module as primary choice, as we will remove umd file in V4.

```diff
- <script src='//unpkg.com/@waline/client@v2/dist/waline.js'></script>
<link href='//unpkg.com/@waline/client@v2/dist/waline.css' rel='stylesheet' />
- <script>
-  Waline.init({
+ <script type="module">
+  import { init } from 'https://unpkg.com/@waline/client@v3/dist/waline.mjs';
+
+  init({
    el: '#waline',
    serverURL: 'YOUR SERVER URL'
  });
  </script>
```

### CSS variables

All `bgcolor` in CSS variable names changed to `bg-color`.
